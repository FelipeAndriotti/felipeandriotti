I am a Software Analysis and Development student at FIAP, I am in the last semester, I take several complementary courses, both at Alura, FIAP, among other teaching platforms. I don't plan to stop my studies any time soon. I am a Full Stack development intern at a Fintech company in the payment technology area, called PagBrasil.
