I have a bachelor's degree in Software Analysis and Development at FIAP. I take several complementary courses, both at Alura, FIAP, among other teaching platforms. I don't plan to stop my studies any time soon. I am a Full Stack development intern at a Fintech company in the payment technology area, called PagBrasil.

Thinking of optimizing your time, here is a brief description:


- <b> Fluency in the English language;  </b>
- <b> Knowledge in languages such as: PHP, Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS; </b>
- <b> Knowledge in Vue.JS framework; </b>
- <b> Oracle database knowledge; </b>
- <b> Knowledge in cybersecurity and computer networks; </b>
- <b> Knowledge in agile methodologies, mainly SCRUM; </b>



Any questions I am at your disposal,
