I am a fullstack developer at HSC - High Security Center, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP, currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Software Development with Agile Methodology at Uniritter, with a continuous passion for learning. I have lived and studied in the United States for approximately two and a half years, which has given me a high level of fluency in English.

My knowledge includes various programming languages such as <b>PHP</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>, as well as frameworks like <b>Vue.JS</b> and <b>Laravel</b>. Additionally, I have experience in Oracle databases and knowledge in cybersecurity and computer networks.
